# CustomerChurnPrediction
- Customer churn is when customers end their relationship or subscription with a company or service provider. It measures the rate at which customers stop using a companyâ€™s products or services within a given timeframe. Churn is a key metric for businesses, as it directly affects revenue, growth, and customer retention.

- The dataset includes columns like 'RowNumber', 'CustomerId', 'Surname', 'CreditScore', 'Geography', 'Gender', 'Age', 'Tenure', 'Balance', 'NumOfProducts', 'HasCrCard', 'IsActiveMember', 'EstimatedSalary', and 'Exited' (indicating if a customer left), with a total of 10,000 rows.

- We developed a classification model using an artificial neural network (ANN) to analyze customer churn, customizing the model to enhance its predictive accuracy.
